# opcua-LabVIEW
OPC UA wrapper library for LabVIEW written entirely in Rust.
This is just a proof of concept and a feasibility study.

Based on the [server / client API implementation for Rust](https://github.com/FreeOpcUa/async-opcua).

The node's tree builder is based on [OPC UA Server Browser](https://github.com/jacobson3/UA-Server-Browser)
